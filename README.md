## UNFREEZER ##

Sometimes plugins will freeze mobs and not reactivate them.
This plugin will reactivate entities that remain frozen.

This plugin will run on a given interval, default every 200 ticks(10 seconds)
but this can be configured. It also only checks a given range around players,
default 50 blocks. This can also be changed in the configuration.
